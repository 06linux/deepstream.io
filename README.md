deepstream.io
==============================================
A scalable server for realtime apps
----------------------------------------------

**Disclaimer** deepstream.io is nearing feature completion, but that's a very different thing to being done. It's not officially released yet. Use at your own risk.

### What is deepstream.io?
deepstream.io is a server for realtime data-structures, written in node.js. It provides three core concepts: **Records** which are observable and persistant JSON-objects, **Events** which are useful for one-to-(one/many) messaging and **Rpcs** remote procedure calls which offer request-response functionality. All these are exposed through a JavaScript client that works in both node and browsers. (And going forward clients in other languages)
